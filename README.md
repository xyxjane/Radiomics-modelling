# Radiomics-modelling
A pipline of using radiomic features to build prediction model which includes feature extraction and feature elimination 
the requirements:
pandas   /                                         
scikit-image /

You can use feature extraction.py to extract the radiomics features you may be interested in. 
Then all the features will be save in excel. Feature elimination.py is used for feature reduction.
